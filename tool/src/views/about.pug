         h1 The NFT Guild Verification Tool
         span This tool verifies and validates the metadata of Cardano NFTs.

      div(class="about-section")
         span Itâ€™s a solution built for the Cardano blockchain, aimed at ensuring the authenticity and proper registration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). By utilizing standards set forth in CIPs 88, 25, 27, 67, and 68, it offers a straightforward way for users to verify NFT metadata, policy compliance, and royalty agreements. This tool is particularly useful for creators who mint NFTs, as well as collectors and traders looking to confirm the legitimacy of their digital assets. We will also offer a verification API for marketplaces, wallets and other dapps that want to integrate the verification system we developed.

      div(class="about-section")
         span This tool simplifies the verification process by providing a clear interface for checking various aspects of an NFT, including its policy registration, associated metadata, and any applicable royalties. It's designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to individuals regardless of their technical expertise in blockchain technology. Whether you're verifying the originality of a digital artwork minted as an NFT or ensuring that a collectible complies with the Cardano blockchain standards, this tool provides the necessary features to support your needs.

      div(class="about-section")
         span Understanding the dynamic nature of the blockchain, the NFT Verification Tool is built to adapt to future changes and updates within the Cardano ecosystem. It stands as a reliable resource for the community, promoting transparency and trust in the NFT market. For anyone involved in the creation, collection, or trading of NFTs on Cardano, this tool offers a streamlined approach to verifying the authenticity and compliance of digital assets.
