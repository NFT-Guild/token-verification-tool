# Cardano Token Verification Tool
In Catalyst Fund 8, the NFT-Guild got funding for the project proposal [NFT Verification Tool](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/62083). The result of this project will be an open source tool that will aid Cardano token buyers in verifying the validity of a certain token.

This project will implement a tool according to CIPs [86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0068) and [88](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0088) for Cardano tokens. CIP 88 is not yet released, but most of the details are good enough defined to get started.

On a high level we envision a tool that can be 
1. integrated into wallets and marketplace platforms
2. automatically queried through an API layer hosted by NFT Guild partners
3. manually queried (searched) by users that want to do check token project validity on a web site hosted by NFT Guild partners
